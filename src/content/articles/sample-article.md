## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is male enhancement safe for everyone?

Men with certain medical conditions, those taking specific medications, or those with a history of genital surgery should consult with a healthcare provider before beginning any enhancement program.

### How long does it take to see safe results?

Safe, permanent results take time. With clinically proven methods like SizeGenetics, most men begin to see measurable improvements after 3-6 months of consistent use. The gradual nature of these changes is actually a sign of safety—rapid changes often indicate potentially harmful methods.

### Can I use multiple enhancement methods together?

Combining methods can increase risks and should only be done under professional guidance. It's generally safer to focus on one proven method like SizeGenetics rather than trying multiple approaches simultaneously.

### What should I do if I experience problems?

Stop using any enhancement method immediately if you experience problems. Contact your healthcare provider for evaluation and guidance. If you're using SizeGenetics, you can also contact their customer support team for assistance.
